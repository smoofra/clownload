# ðŸ¤¡ ðŸŽª clownload ðŸŽª ðŸ¤¡

A tool to download files from clown computers.

## Setup

* `pip install clownload`

* `export DROPBOX_TOKEN=...`.   Create a token [here][apps].


## Usage


### Download from Dropbox
```sh
python clownload.py dropbox --source SOURCE DEST
```

This will download all files from dropbox folder `SOURCE` to local
directory `DEST`.

It will also create a csv file called `DEST/checksums.csv` with the dropbox
content hashes of all the downloaded files.

Local files that have already been downloaded will be skipped.

Any existing files under `DEST` whose name conflicts will be moved aside to
names like `file.old.1` and `file.old.2`.

Additional csv files with known hashes to skip can be specified with `--known`.

### Calculate Checksums
```sh
clownload calcsums .
```

Calculate content hashes of local files and save them to `checksums.csv`.
